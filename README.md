This repository holds the proposal "Guidance around security in R".

## Background 

There are quite a few tools around security in R but no central list and no beginner-friendly resources (AFAIK).

List of packages e.g. https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/33 

## Objectives

* Set up a website listing and explaining resources. Maybe as a CTV.

* Fill all the blanks in https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-security-practices/

* Assess where tooling development is still needed
