This repository holds the proposal "Guidance around security in R".

## Background 

There are quite a few tools around security in R (and quite a few risks!) but no central list and no beginner-friendly resources (AFAIK).

List of packages e.g. https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/33 also see https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/06/06/unconf18_recap_2/

Provide guidance for users, developers, administrators. Make it easy to understand and easy to put in practice.

## Objectives

* Set up a website listing and explaining resources. Maybe as a CTV.

* Fill all the blanks in https://ropenscilabs.github.io/r-security-practices/ Add examples, diagrams.

* Assess where tooling development is still needed

* Create a system for folks to provide tutorials for the website. Write best practice for said tutorials.
